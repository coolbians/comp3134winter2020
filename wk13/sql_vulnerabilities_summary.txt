1)
The query will only select rows where the column Active = 1.
The row with first name "Ben" was found but since the Active column = 0, it does not fulfill the query and no results are returned as expected

2)
The results are not as expected. It returns the row though it does not fulfill the query. It appears as though the second part of the WHERE clause 
which specifies only rows with Active=0 is being ignored

3)
The results are as expected. No results are returned
